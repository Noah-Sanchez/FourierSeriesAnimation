# Fourier Series Animation
Processing animation of a simple form of fourier series.

A fourier series is a representation of a function by a series(hence the name) of sinosuidal components.
The default exaple is a sawtooth wave of the form sin(1)/1 + sin(2)/2 ... + sin(n)/n, evaluated to a arbitrary total of 14 iterations.
Feel free to play around with the fourier_point class and mark any issues, improvements or optimizations.

Keep on vibin.
